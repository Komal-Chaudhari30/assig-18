So, for travel agencies, it’s difficult to stay afloat without a specific niche Distrust. People tend to be skeptical and even suspicious in arranging their trips. They would rather follow word of mouth, go to their old, time-tested local travel agent, or stick to larger players, even if they are not totally satisfied.

Here, the choice of distribution channel plays a decisive role.</p>

        <h1>travelling instruction</h1>
        <p class="text font text:hover">Carry valid identification documents to the airport. Domestic passengers should have an ID card (Aadhaar, driving licence, PAN, voter ID), while international passengers must have their passport. Depending upon your airline’s policy, bring a hard copy/soft copy of your air ticke  For seamless boarding, you must have your boarding pass. Get it printed at the check-in kiosks at Delhi Airport. For a comfortable flying experience, consider bringing a neck pillow, headphones, chargers, eye masks, medications, sanitisers, and travel-sized toiletri Install the necessary travel apps on your phone and have it handy. Wearing expensive, flashy jewelry is one sure way to make yourself an obvious target for robbery. Leave it at home, friends, especially if you plan to travel to crowded areas! Any solid resource of travel safety information will tell you that it's never a good idea to carry huge amounts of cash. Instead, open an account with an international bank or credit card company so you can use local ATMs. If you absolutely must withdraw large amounts of cash at once, leave the bulk of it locked up safely in your hotel or hostel and carry only what you'll need for the day. When using ATMs, try to use only those that are attached to banks as these are less likely to have been tampered with by scammers.</p>
